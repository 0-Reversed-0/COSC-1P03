         * 1) it converts the current state to a double via casting
         * 2) I divide the current state by the Integer Max Value
         *
         * I convert the state to a double so the result would be in a double
         * The reason why I divide it by specifically integer max value is because we want the current state is in decimal form,
         * Because current state can have a result for mod 1 if done so
         * Normally if you do any# % mod 1 it would give 0 since divide anything by 1 it would be give no remainder
         * This is problem because we want to go from [0, 1) and setting a boundary like 0.99999... would not cut it since 0.99999... included in the boundary
         * But casting current state do a double wouldn't do the trick either because 26782173.00 % 1 = 0 regardless
         * If we divide current state by a crazy long number like Integer Max Value (not double.max or long.max because it would result in a crazy long decimal) then,
         * Current state (decimal state now) would become a crazy fraction giving us decimals at the end
         * Then once the state is calculated in the modulo it essentially cuts off the whole number part of the number and only evaluates the decimal since thinking logically,
         * how many times does 1 go into 26782173.48392048? 26782173 times would be the answer. Leaving us 0.48392048 which would be our new random number
         * Even if in the rare chance that the state is a multiple of integer max value which would give a remainder of 0; it would still be valid since 0 is included in the range.
         * This also explains why we use Max value because there little to no chance of getting a multiple of that value since it is a huge number
         * This way of doing things may loose precision but in my case I could not care less since it does the job man

         * To understand this line of code we can break it down into a few steps:
         *
         * 1) We first and foremost subtract the lower bound from the upper bound!
         * 2) We get the remainder of the internalState when divided by the result of the previous step!!
         * 3) We add the lower bound to that result of the step above!!!
         * 4) We make sure it does not go out of the integer max value!!!!
         * 5) We finally cast the long into an int so it can be stored in the "random" variable!!!!!
         *
         * To understand why we did the first step, it's because we just want the range of values without caring where it starts and ends
         * Then with that range we want our state to be in bounds of the range
         * Afterward we add the lower bound so that we no matter what it starts from the lower bound, and it never goes above the upper bound
         * Example: (21 % (10-5) ) + 5 -> (21 % 5) + 5 -> 21mod5 = 1 ... 1 + 5 = 6. 6 would be inbounds for lower/upper bound of 5 - 10
