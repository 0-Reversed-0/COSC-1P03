This is a repository includes all the university course work done in COSC 1P03, Data Structures, which includes labs, assignments, and lecture notes taken in class and added on later.
This course goes into moderate detail of data structures like linked lists, arrays, stacks, and queues while also introducing ADTs, sorting, recursion, searching, and software design.
This repository's assignments have some labelled as V2 for the spring term assignments and the unlabelled assignments were for the winter term. It also uses the Brock.jar Package
I made this repository to hopefully help anyone who comes by it and to prove I took this coruse!
